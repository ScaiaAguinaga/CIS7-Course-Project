# CIS7-Course-Project
This program is my Blackjack course project submission for CIS 7.
When ran, this program will prompt and guide the user through a step by step process on playing Blackjack.

## Instructions
Upon download of the file, you should be able to run and compile the solution to it.
After compiling the solution, the program will begin its work.
It should ask you for a name and betting amount, followed by a step by step console output of the current state of the game from player hands, to drawing cards, and eventually the winner.
This program will automatically handle the function of the aces for optimal play for any player with one in possesion.

### Programming Approach
This program is written 100% in C++.
Key libraries include iostream, string, cstdlib, ctime, and iomanip
For creation of this project, I decided to keep it all in one source file as opposed to splitting it up. This was for personal preference and simplicity.
A key challenge was designing a system that would detect if a player has an ace and automatically change or shrink its value down to a 1 to prevent them from busting.
